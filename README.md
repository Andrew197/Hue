Hue is a platformer game for Windows, Mac, and Linux set in a colorless world. Using the player's choice of six abilities,
the player must navigate through the world without being caught by an enemy or falling to their death.
Each ability can be used for both combat with enemies and platform traversal, allowing each level to be solved six different ways.
